  "body": "# Automation FOrensics Tool\r\n\r\nThe Automation FOrensics Tool (AFOT) is an automation tool build in Python and used for Windows Forensics in order to combine the following tools:\r\n- AnalyzePESig (http://didierstevens.com/files/software/AnalyzePESig_V0_0_0_2.zip)\r\n- National Software Reference Library reduced set (http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/RDS/rds_2.52/rds_252m.zip)\r\n- NSRL Tool (http://didierstevens.com/files/software/nsrl_V0_0_2.zip)\r\n- VirusTotal Search Tool (http://didierstevens.com/files/software/virustotal-search_V0_1_2.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe script makes use of Python version 2.7, but it will most likely work with Python 3.\r\nYou will need to have **PIP** installed in your system. Please see [python docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for details.\r\n\r\nYou should have your own a VirusTotal api key. Just create an account in VirusTotal website and grab the api key. Then add it as the `__VIRUSTOTALAPIKEY__` value.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nJust run `python afot.py` in your terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Procedure\r\n\r\nSo the procedure is pretty straight-forward:\r\n* The user provides the path, which will be used to analyze all the executables included in those folders/subfolders.\r\n* **AnalyzePESig** looks for signed executables, whom certificate will soon be revoked.\r\n* **AFOT** will collect all the non-signed executables and cross-check them with NSRL's hashset database, using the **NSRL** tool.\r\n* Last but not least, if any hashes were found to be in NSRL's hashset database too, we cross-check those hashes with **VirusTotal**, using the VirusTotal Search tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/harris21/afot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT).
